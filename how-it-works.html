    <h1>How the Truck ETA Calculator Works</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p>The Truck ETA Calculator is designed to estimate the arrival time of a truck based on several factors including distance, average speed, start time, and hours left to drive before starting. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Distance:</strong> The total distance to be traveled in miles.</li>
            <li><strong>Speed:</strong> The average speed of the truck in miles per hour.</li>
            <li><strong>Start Time:</strong> The time when the trip is scheduled to start.</li>
            <li><strong>Hours Left:</strong> The number of hours the driver has left to drive before starting the trip.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The calculator takes into account the following constraints:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Driving Hours Per Day:</strong> Maximum of 11 hours of driving per day.</li>
            <li><strong>Break Time:</strong> A mandatory 30-minute break after 8 hours of driving.</li>
            <li><strong>Off-Duty Time:</strong> 10 hours of rest after a driving shift.</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-Trip and Post-Trip Inspections:</strong> 15 minutes each for inspections.</li>
            <li><strong>Fueling Time:</strong> 30 minutes for refueling.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By considering these factors, the calculator provides an estimated time of arrival (ETA) in ISO format.</p>
